# LUMINARY
A game engine for SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis in 68000 assembly.

Successor to the TANGLEWOOD engine and framework.

Nothing much to see here just yet, will add docs and build instructions when it's a bit more off the ground.


Named after the Lunar Module mission software for the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) on Apollo 11. Happy 50th anniversary of the moon landing!
